Error in `[.data.frame`(all_imp, -dont_keep[sample(x = dont_keep, size = 1)]) :

Ok, this (404-rf-analysis.R) failed at the point where it didn't fail with the test data.

I tried running a couple of loops, and it ran to completion.

Hmmm... maybe the thing to do is run it in a window as opposed to RScript?


Pasted up to the end of the loop (saving image0.rda).
