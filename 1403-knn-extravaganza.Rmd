## Picking the most accurate
We need to sample different individuals and down SNPs to find the most accurate set of SNPs for assignment.

100 x sets of individuals (maybe 100 resamplings), find average best K
use 1 through 100 of the best SNPs and compare

Maybe create the same 100 individual sets to apply across 1 -> 100 SNPs

I could make a function and lapply? Each entry would be an individual/phenotype for training.
